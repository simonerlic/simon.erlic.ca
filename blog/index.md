# Welcome to my blog.
Essentially, this is the record of my hobbies, projects, life and general interests.
In other words, its a log of whatever I am up to at the moment.

## About Me.
Hi! I'm Simon, a student at the University of Victoria, a filmmaker, but most importantly, _a maker_.
And so, with that introduction out of the way, here's my blog.

#### So, what is this going to be used for anyways?
The idea behind this site is going to mainly be somewhere for me to simply talk about my projects, life,
 and essentially anything that interests me at the moment. 

###### With that out of the way, feel free to look around!
